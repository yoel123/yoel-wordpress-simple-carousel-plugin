a simple responsive image carousel

== Description ==
this plugin is for creating a responsive coverflow  image carousel .

the default size of an img is 320 px on desktop and 200px on mobile.
the css of the plugin is also simple to edit.

i created it for use as is.the height and width are perfect in my opinion.
